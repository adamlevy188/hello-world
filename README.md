# hello-world

I'm a fifth year undergrad at the University of Minnesota studying computer science! I'm involved with our university's small satellite program where we're developing two satellites that will be sent up into space in 2023. In my free time, I like to read. I'm currently reading Bertrand Russell's "The History of Western Philosophy".
